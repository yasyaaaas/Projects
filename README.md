# Projects
  The 'projects' repository on GitHub is the place where I share the results of my programming studies and the creation of my own projects. Here, you will find a little bit of my journey, from learning languages to developing interesting projects. This space reflects my commitment to programming and records not only what I studied at PUC Minas, but also the experiences that helped me evolve as a programmer. 

At PUC Minas, I am immersed in a learning environment that has contributed a lot to the improvement of my coding skills. This repository is more than just code and projects; It's a way to share my journey in an accessible way. Feel free to explore and maybe discover something interesting among the codes and ideas.
